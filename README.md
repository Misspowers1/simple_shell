# C - Simple Shell

This project is a simple implementation of a Unix shell written in C. The shell has the ability to execute simple commands and display the output of those commands to the terminal. The shell has a basic user interface which allows the user to enter commands and view their output.

The shell supports a variety of built-in commands, including cd, pwd, echo, and exit. It also supports command-line arguments, environment variables, and IO redirects.

This project is a collaborative effort between Edna and Suleiman. Edna has implemented the basic user interface, command execution and IO redirects, while Suleiman has developed the built-in commands and environment variables.

We hope that this project is useful and that it can serve as a starting point for more complex shells.
